Structures are a way to group several related variables into one place. 
Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure

For example:
syntax:

struct [structure tag] {

   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more structure variables];  

Example:

struct student{
    
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
    float mark;
}s1,s2;
